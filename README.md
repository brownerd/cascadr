# Cascadr

This little AppleScript App will Cascade Google Chrome windows only.

I typically have a ton of windows open at the same time. After resizing these manually for years, I hacked the scripts below to create an AppleScript to do the window cascading for me.

## Future dev
I might add these features:

- Enable prompt at runtime to allow user to type in the application they want cascaded
- Run from hot key
- Create options window
